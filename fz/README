This folder is used for the flatzinc interface. You first need to compile the code with:

$ make

You can test a flatzinc instance with

$ ./mistral-fz -t 3 --details --nb_configurations 10 data/example_satisfaction.fzn

We shall use three options: 
	1/ "-t": To use 'v' as the runtime limit 
	2/ "--details": a Boolean to print details. The default value is false. Therefore the solver will print only the instance characteristics followed by the scores of the different configurations
	3/ "--nb_configurations v": To indicate the number of configurations to try. The default value is 6.

Three fzn files are given in the data/ folder. Also, the data/ folder contains compressed benchmarks (used in the 2017 .. 2020 competitions)

To compile fzn files, you need first to install minizinc. To generate an fzn instance (flattened.fzn) using an mzn file (f.mzn) and a dzn file (d.dzn), use the following command from within the fz/folder: 

$minizinc --compile --solver org.minizinc.mzn-fzn -I mznlib/ f.mzn d.dzn --fzn flattened.fzn 



Notes:

*/ Compilation note: If the solver does not plot any information, you need to recompile your code with g++-05. 
*/ The aim of the output is to give the score of each configuration. The score of a configuration is based of the running time, the proof of optimality, and the oobjective value found by the configuration. The score is a value in [0,100] where 100 is the best score and 0 is the worst score.
